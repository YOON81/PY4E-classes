# 5.2 Write a program that repeatedly prompts a user for integer numbers until
# the user enters 'done'. Once 'done' is entered, print out the largest and
# smallest of the numbers. If the user enters anything other than a valid number
# catch it with a try/except and put out an appropriate message and ignore the
# number. Enter 7, 2, bob, 10, and 4 and match the output below.

while True:

    if num == 'done':
        break
    try:
        num = int(num)
        if smallest is None or num < smallest:
            smallest = num
